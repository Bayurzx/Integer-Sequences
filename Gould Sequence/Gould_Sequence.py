 * Gould' Sequence Example
 * Row Number                Pascal's triangle                 count of odd numbers in ith row
 * 0th row                             1                                         1

 * 4th row                     1   4   6   4   1                                 2
 * 5th row                   1   5   10  10  5   1                               4
 * 6th row                 1   6   15  20  15  6   1                             4
 * 7th row               1   7   21  35  35  21  7   1                           8
 * 8th row             1  8   28   56  70   56  28  8  1                         2
 * 9th row           1   9  36  84  126  126  84  36  9  1                       4
 * 10th row        1  10  45  120 210  256  210 120 45 10  1                     4
 *
 * Code Logic
 *
 * for row=5
 * 5 in binary = 101
 * count of 1's =2
 * 22= 4
 *
 * So, 5th row of pascal triangle will have 4 odd number
