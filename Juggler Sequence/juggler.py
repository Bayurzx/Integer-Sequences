# Program to find Juggler Sequence in Python
# Juggler Sequence: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juggler_sequence
# The juggler_sequence function takes in a starting number and prints all juggler
# numbers starting from that number until it reaches 1

# Keep in mind that the juggler sequence has been conjectured to reach 1 eventually
# but this fact has not yet been proved
